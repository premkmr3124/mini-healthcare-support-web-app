# Mini Healthcare Support Web App

## Problem Statement
NGOs often face difficulties in collecting, organizing, and reviewing healthcare support requests efficiently due to unstructured communication methods.

## Solution
This web application allows patients to submit healthcare support requests through a simple and structured form.

An automation feature generates a short, readable summary for each request to help NGOs understand and respond faster.

## Features

- Automated request summary generation
- Recent reports storage for quick review
- Clean and user-friendly UI

## AI / Automation Idea
The application uses rule-based automation to generate summaries from patient inputs and assist users through a chatbot interface.

In the future, this system can be extended using AI models to classify urgency and recommend response actions.

## Tech Stack

- Browser LocalStorage
- Hosted on Vercel / Netlify

## NGO Use Case
NGOs can use this system to:
- Collect patient requests digitally
